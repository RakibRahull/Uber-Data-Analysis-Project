2. Which day had the highest number of trips?
3. Which weekday had the highest earnings and trips?
4. Which vehicle is most commonly used by Uber riders?
5. Which payment type do users most commonly use?
6. What are the total earnings and trips per city?
7. What are the top 10 areas by number of trips?

## Process
The data analysis process began with meticulous data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to handle missing values and ensure data integrity. Subsequently, key performance indicators were calculated with DAX measures and visualized through interactive charts and reports. These were then compiled into a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with dynamic slicers, enabling flexible and detailed analysis.

## Project Insights
1. Trips and earnings are significantly higher on weekends, with Saturday and Sunday being the top-performing days.
2. Uberpay is the most common payment method, while the UberX vehicle type is the most frequently requested.
3. The top three contributing metropolitan areas for both trips and earnings are Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn indicating high demand zones.
4. Analysis identified key high-density zones that account for a majority of the trips, while the farthest trips often follow specific inter-city routes.5. Surge pricing is most prevalent in a few specific locations, likely tied to peak-hour demand or special events.
